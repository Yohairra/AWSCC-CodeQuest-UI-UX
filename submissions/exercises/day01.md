#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Comparing Shopee and Lazada, it is much easier to navigate on Lazada because the items are neatly organized. It helps in browsing specific products under the categories. Also, the homepage of Lazada is full of details displayed for customers. 

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: In regards to unnecessary elements, Shopee contains heavy promotion that can easily pique the interest of customers. After opening the app, users are bombarded in Shopee with flash deals, pop-ups, videos, and live selling, which can draw attention away from the items. Meanwhile, the pop-ups on Lazada are much more tolerable than on Shopee.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Lazada has also clearer and more organized visual hierarchy. It allows users to focus on the information that matters most, as well as improve the userâ€™s shopping journey since it is organized systematically. 

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopeeâ€™s vibrancy and bright orange color scheme make the whole platform feel like full of clutter, combined with pop-up advertisements that cover other important aspects. On the other hand, Lazada is much easier in the eyes and has a simplistic approach when it comes to the usage of elements and white spaces. 
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: The difference between the two platforms, in terms of responsiveness on various devices, is that Lazada offers a seamless experience on desktop and mobile. Shopee may be easy packed with what the users need once the app/website was opened, however, the speed in loading all elements takes quite some time. I think it is because of the interface looks packed and messy with all the unnecessary things.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: I preferred Lazada in terms of the visual aspects since I think the color scheme is commendable when it comes to pulling the user into buying.
